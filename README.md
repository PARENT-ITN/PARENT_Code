# PARENT_Code

## Overview
**PARENT_Code** is the centralized codebase developed as part of the **PARENT project** — an interdisciplinary research initiative focused on pediatric and neonatal health. The project integrates clinical data analysis, machine learning, biomarker discovery, and deep learning-based facial and expression analysis to support healthcare research.

This repository brings together multiple research modules of the PARENT project. Each module is self-contained and documented separately to enable ease of use and reproducibility.

## Repository Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different project or study. Refer to the respective `README.md` files inside each folder for details on setup, usage, and data requirements.

- **`Glucose and Brain injury`**  
  Analysis of glucose variability and its relationship with brain injury using clinical or experimental data.

- **`Feature selection and classification of preterm infant data`**  
  Implements machine learning models for identifying key features and classifying preterm infant health data.

- **`Biomarker discovery`**  
  Pipelines for identifying significant biomarkers from clinical or omics datasets using statistical and ML methods.

- **`Automated facial characterization and image retrieval by CNN`**  
  A deep learning pipeline using Convolutional Neural Networks for automated facial analysis and image-based retrieval.

- **`Xception-based Facial Expression Recognition with SHAP-Driven Explainability`**  
  Facial expression recognition using the Xception architecture, with SHAP explainability for model interpretation.

- **`Parsing and analysis of eye-tracking data from test batteries`**  
  A tool for analyzing eye-tracking data generated by the PARENT neuropsychological test battery.
