# LibEtNEUS (public version).

## Analysis and visualization of eye-tracking data.

This library is meant to be used as a tool to analyse eye-tracking data generated by the Neus Software tests.
This is the public version not containing the formulas for covariates. It still contains a dummy task to use as example.

Inside the datasets folder we have included an eye-tracking test raw dataset in json format obtained from one of the operators.
This dataset is used in the examples.

## Main functionalities

- Parse raw eye-tracking data, division into tasks
- Detection of fixations
- Computation of features for each task and composition in a single dataset
- Highly modular; adding tasks is easy
- Tools to reduce the values of the two eyes to a single one
- Visualization tools
